When you create a new React app using create-react-app, the initial file structure looks like this:
```

my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  .gitignore
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    logo192.png
    logo512.png
    manifest.json
    robots.txt
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
    reportWebVitals.js
    setupTests.js
```
Here's a brief explanation of each file and folder:

- README.md:

    This file contains instructions on how to set up and run the React app, as well as details about the project and its features.

- node_modules/:

    This folder contains all the dependencies installed by npm (Node Package Manager). You should not modify the files in this folder manually.

- package.json:
  
   This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It is used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and scripts.

- .gitignore:
  
   This file lists the files and folders that should be ignored by Git, such as the node_modules folder and build artifacts.

- public/:

    This folder contains static files that will be served by the web server. These files are not processed by Webpack, so you can reference them directly using their public URL.

  - favicon.ico:

        The app's favicon.

  - index.html:

        The main HTML file that includes the root element where the React app will be rendered.
  - logo192.png and logo512.png:

        Icons for the app in different sizes.
  - manifest.json:
    
        A manifest file for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that provides metadata about the app, such as name, icons, and theme colors.
  - robots.txt:

        A text file that gives instructions to web robots (e.g., search engine crawlers) about which pages to crawl and which to ignore.

- src/:

    This folder contains the source code of the React app, including components, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

  - App.css:

        The CSS file for the App component.
  - App.js:

        The main App component, which serves as the root component for the entire application.
  - App.test.js:
  
        A test file for the App component, using the Jest testing framework.
  
  - index.css:

        The global CSS file that applies styles to the entire application.
  - index.js:

        The entry point of the React app, where the root component (App) is rendered to the DOM.
  - logo.svg:

        An SVG logo used in the App component.
  - reportWebVitals.js:
    
        A utility for measuring and reporting web performance metrics.
  - setupTests.js:

        A file for configuring the Jest testing environment.

---
In summary, the public folder holds static files, and the src folder contains the source code for the React app. The main entry point for the app is src/index.js, which renders the App component. The App component, defined in src/App.js, serves as the root component for the entire application.
